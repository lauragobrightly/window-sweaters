# Window Sweaters

A little Mac app I made to give my windows sweaters. 🧶
Knitted borders, colours inspired by your favourite apps, and a cosier desktop.

## Get it

You can just send this repo to your coding agent and ask it to install Window Sweaters for you:

> Install Window Sweaters on my Mac: https://github.com/saragordic/window-sweaters

Or install it yourself with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```sh
brew trust saragordic/tap
brew install --cask saragordic/tap/window-sweaters
```

Then open **Window Sweaters** from your Applications folder.

You can also grab the latest ZIP from [Releases](https://github.com/saragordic/window-sweaters/releases), unzip it, and drag **Window Sweaters.app** into Applications.

If macOS blocks it, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway** after trying to launch it. The app isn't notarized by Apple yet. [Apple's instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445) explain this step.

## Make yourself cosy

Click the yarn icon in your menu bar to change the style, pattern, border width, and stitch size. You can also pause the sweaters or quit from there.

**By App** gives each app its own sweater. **Zigzag** gives them all a softer, matching pattern in their own colours. Try both and see what you like.

**By Window** gives windows different sweaters from the existing collection, including windows belonging to different apps. All windows share one design sequence. Each window keeps its design when moved, resized, hidden, or restored during the current run. Designs cycle after the collection is exhausted; assignments start fresh when Window Sweaters restarts. This mode uses the collection's paired colors and patterns, while By App continues to honor your app rules. Choose it under **Pattern → By Window**, or run `WindowSweaters chart=by-window`. Menu selections survive a restart.

If macOS asks for Accessibility access, enable Window Sweaters in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility** so it can follow which window is focused.

## The sweaters

**Custom sweaters for 37 apps, and counting!** Almost 40 little colourways, with colours picked by hand. These are just a few of my favourites:

Shown above in By App and Zigzag. Here’s everyone we’ve knitted for so far:

- **Apple:** Finder, Safari, Mail, Messages, Notes, Calendar, Reminders, Apple Music, Photos, Preview, Terminal.
- **Work and notes:** Notion, Paper, Granola, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Zoom.
- **Coding and AI:** Cursor, VS Code, Claude, ChatGPT, Codex, Grok Bot, Ghostty.
- **Design:** Figma, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator.
- **Microsoft Office:** Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook.
- **More favourites:** Spotify, WhatsApp, Google Chrome, Firefox, Telegram, Discord.

See every sweater and its close-up stitches in the [catalogue](docs/COLLECTION.md), or download the [By App PDF](docs/catalogues/Window-Sweaters-Catalogue.pdf) and [Zigzag PDF](docs/catalogues/Window-Sweaters-Zigzag-Catalogue.pdf).

The app colours are picked by hand, not read from your app icons. Apps without their own sweater still get a border in a colour chosen from their name, so it stays the same every time.

## A little work in progress

I built this on my Mac and use it myself, but there are still rough edges. Borders hide while you resize a window and return when you're done.

The app is built for **macOS 13 or later, on Apple Silicon and Intel**. I've tested it on Apple Silicon with macOS 26; older macOS versions and Intel Macs haven't had the same hands-on testing. It uses private macOS window APIs, so system updates may affect how it works.

If something looks wrong, [open an issue](https://github.com/saragordic/window-sweaters/issues) and tell me your macOS version, Mac model, and whether you're using another screen. Reproduction steps help a lot.

## Build it yourself

You'll need Apple's Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`) and Python 3.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/saragordic/window-sweaters.git
cd window-sweaters
./scripts/build-app.sh
python3 scripts/install-local.py
```

This builds `outputs/Window Sweaters.app`, installs it in `~/Applications`, and opens it. The installer backs up any previous local installation before replacing it.

## Your own colourways

If you'd like to experiment, edit these files and restart the app:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/Knit Borders/apps.conf
~/Library/Application Support/Knit Borders/charts/
```

The folder still uses the app's original name so existing settings keep working. For example, an app rule looks like this:

```text
Claude = #D58561 atelier-claude
```

Names match app-name prefixes, ignoring capitalisation; the longest match wins. You can also put your own PNG charts in the charts folder to replace built-in patterns.

If you like setting things up from the command line, Window Sweaters also runs an optional shell script at startup, if you have one at `~/.config/window-sweaters/sweatersrc` or `~/.sweatersrc`.

## Taking it off

Quit Window Sweaters from the yarn icon first. Then, if you installed it with Homebrew:

```sh
brew uninstall --zap --cask window-sweaters
```

`--zap` also removes your saved colourways. Leave it off to keep them for later.

If you installed it by hand, drag **Window Sweaters.app** to the Trash, then delete these if you want everything gone:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/Knit Borders
~/Library/Preferences/local.knitborders.app.plist
```

macOS remembers the Accessibility permission separately, so remove Window Sweaters from **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility** too.
